# TODO items

- Major issues:

  - Use LSP to rename/delete files
  - Auto setup for pylsp (e.g. PyslpInstall)

- Minor issues:

  - Add auto close brackets
  - Add preview capability for markdown files
  - Auto detect vertical/horizontal monitor for telescope layout
  - Auto clean up unlisted lsp servers
  - Remove buffer from telescope view
  - Add debugger (pdb)

- Miscellaneous issues:

  - Add highlight support for line diff for git commit and merge requests
  - Allow highlighting and moving the line
    (like hightlight with 'shift'+'ctrl'+up/down arrow key)
  - Fix TODO highlight in docstring

- Nice to have
  - SQL LSP through local dll files
  - Go through LazyVim language setup for python/SQL/md
  - Set up treesitter-textobjects keymaps (currently no example on lazy.vim)
